# Elgato App Store archive

As of version 6.4 of the Stream Deck software, the Elgato App Store is being replaced. The new Elgato Marketplace requires an account to download plugins and it feels like microtransactions and subscription services are on the way. This repository contains the most recent version (as of January 2024) of every plugin listed in the Elgato App Store if you prefer to avoid the Elgato Marketplace.

I am not the creator of any of these plugins. These are not pirated or illegally obtained - they are downloaded directly from Elgato's servers.
